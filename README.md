# BlockSignal

BlockSignal is a secure instant messaging application based on Signal Android which is developed by Open Whisper Systems. Moreover, it uses a blockchain-based identity, authentication and storage platform, Blockstack, to verify the identities of users so as to prevent possible Man-in-the-Middle attacks. This feature provides an automatized authentication ceremony mechanism which is the users' responsibility to perform in the original Signal. Therefore, in BlockSignal, being secure does not depend on user security awareness.

This work is in the scope of master thesis and the corresponding research paper of Enes Altuncu under supervision of Professor Kemal Bıçakcı from TOBB University of Economics and Technology.

# Support

As BlockSignal has been developed for the academic purposes, it is not a fully-tested software to be used as a commercial product. Therefore, it may (most probably, does) contain some bugs which are not in our responsibility meaning that we may not always have time to solve the issues reported. However, it is recommended to report the possible issues to inform other developers that might encounter the same issues later.
